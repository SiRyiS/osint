# OSINT Flow Methodology

This general methodology provides a structure for conducting Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations. The process involves gathering, analyzing, and interpreting publicly available information to achieve specific objectives such as cybersecurity or investigative research. All activities should be conducted within legal, approved, and ethical boundaries. Thanks to HTB for the flow foundations.
